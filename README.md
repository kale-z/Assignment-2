## Usage
To run this project after cloning, run the following command first for migration
```
python manage.py migrate
```

Then, running the local server
```
python manage.py runserver
```
_Note: after running the project locally, you may need to add the URL's slug manually from ```urls.py``` as the homepage was not set_
